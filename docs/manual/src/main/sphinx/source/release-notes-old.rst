Release Notes (4.7.x and below)
===============================

.. _glu-4.7.3:

5.5.1 & 4.7.3 (2014/04/21)
--------------------------

This release is a bug fix release. Due to the nature of the bug, both the main branch as well as the 4.7.x branch (for java 1.6) have been updated.

The bug is rare but can happen while upgrading glu: it manifests itself by bad data being written to ZooKeeper (only when the agent cannot instantiate a previously deployed glu script) and the console does not handle it properly. The fix is 2 fold:

  * fixed the agent to not write bad data in ZooKeeper
  * fixed the console to handle improper data in ZooKeeper

* Fixed `glu-262 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/262>`_: `A bad agent should not bring the console down`

.. _glu-4.7.2:

4.7.2 (2013/05/09)
------------------

This release is a bug fix release.

* Fixed `glu-223 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/223>`_: `jdk1.7 workaround does not "persist" in 4.7.1`

.. _glu-4.7.1:

4.7.1 (2013/04/16)
------------------

This release is a bug fix release.

.. warning:: this version should be used instead of 4.7.0 due to the `critical bug <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/214>`_

* Implemented `glu-205 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/205>`_: `Make zookeeperRoot configurable in console`
* Implemented `glu-206 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/206>`_: `Allow agent to bind to a specified network interface`
* Fixed `glu-207 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/207>`_: `Agent fails to restart if cannot reload scripts`
* Implemented `glu-210 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/210>`_: `Agent not recreating ephemeral node after ZK outage`
* Fixed `glu-211 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/211>`_: `Add Support to Users for Default Fabric`
* Fixed `glu-212 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/212>`_: `agent returns a 405 when Accept header with a value of 'application/json' is specified`
* Fixed `glu-213 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/213>`_: `Glu console does more absolute url redirects with 4.7.0`
* Fixed `glu-214 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/214>`_: `Upgrading from 4.6.2 to 4.7.0 breaks all user roles`

.. note:: Due to the fact that `glu-210 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/210>`_ is (most likely) a race condition, a monitor has been added to the agent in order to detect (and correct) the situation. This will hopefully provide more insight into the problem. In order to disable the monitor, set the property ``glu.agent.zkMonitor.enabled`` to ``false``.

.. _glu-4.7.0:

4.7.0 (2013/04/02)
------------------

.. warning:: * 2013/04/15 update: a `critical bug <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/214>`_ has been found in this release if you are using the ``console.datasource.table.user.mapping`` configuration option (which allows you to rename the ``user`` table). If you are, do not upgrade to this version.
             * 2013/04/16 update: the bug has been resolved in version 4.7.1

This release contains a major upgrade of all the libraries used by glu. The purpose of this release is to allow glu to finally be able to run under any java VM including java 1.7 (as java 1.6 is now no longer supported by Oracle). Here are the requirements in terms of VM version(s):

+----------------+-----------------------------------+
|glu version     |java version(s)                    |
+================+===================================+
| 5.0.0+         |java 1.7                           |
+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4.7.x          |java 1.6 (any VM) or java 1.7      |
+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 4.6.x and below|java 1.6 (with Sun/Oracle VM only!)|
+----------------+-----------------------------------+

The next major release of glu (5.0.0) will support java 1.7 only. As a result, the 4.7.x line is also the recommended upgrade path from any prior version of glu since it will be the only line that will support both 1.6 and 1.7 java VMs!

The code in glu has not changed much in this release, but it contains a whole set of new libraries. Although glu has been tested thoroughly (including longevity tests which uncovered some memory leak in the latest version of groovy!), you should use caution when upgrading to this version and make sure you test it on a small set of nodes prior to making a big push.

.. note:: One notable change is the use of the latest version of ZooKeeper (3.4.5). Although the ZooKeeper servers do not need to be upgraded (backward compatible), it is advised to upgrade them and you should follow the procedure described on the ZooKeeper web site.

* Fixed `glu-74 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/74>`_: `NPE when opening the Dashboard in the tutorial`
* Implemented `glu-109 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/109>`_: `Make build compatible with Gradle version 1.0-milestone-3`
* Fixed `glu-123 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/123>`_: `Hammering console with several simple REST requests in parallel leads to strange groovy error`
* Implemented `glu-135 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/135>`_: `Migrate to latest grails/groovy`
* Fixed `glu-143 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/143>`_: `Removal of hardcoded 'java' command from zk.sh`
* Implemented `glu-148 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/148>`_: `Upgrade to gradle 1.0`
* Fixed `glu-193 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/193>`_: `Add support for nesting /console/ in a sub url in console-cli.py and PEP-8 Python style compliance`
* Fixed `glu-199 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/199>`_: `Cannot resolve reference to bean LightUserCustomDeltaDefinitionDomainClass`
* Fixed `glu-201 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/201>`_: `Incorrect plan generated from console-cli`
* Fixed `glu-208 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/208>`_: `When no (console) plugins available, getting a warning message from jetty (8)`

Thanks to `JProfiler <http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html>`_ for providing a free license key in order to troubleshoot (and very quickly identify!) the memory leak in groovy.

.. _glu-4.6.2:

4.6.2 (2013/01/21)
------------------

This release is a bug fix release only.

* Fixed `glu-195 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/195>`_: `Very long lines in an application log are loaded surprisingly slow when browsing from Console`
* Fixed `glu-196 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/196>`_: `DisabledFeatureProxy should proceed hashCode and equals methods to avoid breaking Spring ApplicationContext`
* Fixed `glu-197 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/197>`_: `Once a fabric is deleted cannot create a new fabric with the same name`
* Fixed `glu-198 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/198>`_: `Child not able to generate Parent Plan`

.. _glu-4.6.1:

4.6.1 (2012/12/21)
------------------

This release is essentially a bug fix release with a couple of minor enhancements to the agent api.

* Fixed `glu-134 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/134>`_: `Race condition between agent.waitForState and ZooKeeper state`
* Fixed `glu-177 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/177>`_: `No plan generated when mountpoint not deployed with REST api`
* Fixed `glu-178 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/178>`_: `Install script agent REST api not handling path correctly`
* Fixed `glu-181 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/181>`_: `Using an unknown fabric in console REST call works`
* Fixed `glu-182 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/182>`_: `Delta engine reports success when agents are missing`
* Implemented `glu-185 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/185>`_: `Add "pwd" to generic shell.exec command`
* Implemented `glu-191 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/191>`_: `Add rootShell to GluScript`
* Implemented `glu-192 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/192>`_: `Add "env" to generic shell command`
* Implemented `glu-193 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/193>`_: `Add support for nesting /console/ in a sub url in console-cli.py and PEP-8 Python style compliance` (Thanks to St√©phane)
* Implemented `glu-194 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/194>`_: `Find a new "Downloads" space`

.. note:: Due to `github deprecating the Download/Upload feature <https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads>`_, the binary release has been moved to a new `location <http://www.pongasoft.com/glu/downloads/>`_.

.. _glu-4.6.0:

4.6.0 (2012/11/18)
------------------

This release contains the new feature ``commands`` which extends glu capabilities in order to execute an arbitrary (unix/shell) command on any node. One way to think about it is executing a remote command using a REST api rather than ssh. It provides the added benefit that all commands executed this way are following the `standard` authentication and auditing path followed by deployments. The ``All commands`` view shows you instantly what is (or has been) executing on various agents, thus allowing you to immediately get a sense of what other `actions` (besides deployments) have been performed on an agent for tracking and/or diagnosing purposes.

.. note:: This feature may be disabled entirely. If you are using your own configuration file it will have to be enabled explicitely. If you use the configuration files coming with the distribution, it is enabled by default.

* Implemented `glu-166 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/166>`_: `Allow agent to run any kind of command`
* Implemented `glu-169 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/169>`_: `Add a shell.exec api to also expose stderr`
* Implemented `glu-170 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/170>`_: `Add "start" in the plans subtab`


4.5.2 (2012/10/31)
------------------

.. warning:: This release contains a critical bug fix and is highly recommended. 

Only the agent needs to be upgraded. The issue fixed is the ability to talk to the agent over ssl without any certificate (the agent is not honoring the ``needClientAuth`` flag).

.. note:: In order to know if you are affected by this issue and you should upgrade, follow the 
          simple steps:

          * if you are running your agent with ``sslEnabled`` set to ``false`` then you are not affected
          * otherwise run the following command::

             curl -v -k https://<agentIP>:<agentPort>/agent

            * if you receive an error message then you are not affected by the issue
            * if you do not receive an error message and simply an OK (200) response from the agent (which should be 
              a json document with the list of all mount points), then you are affected and it is highly 
              recommended to upgrade

* Fixed `glu-175 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/175>`_: `client auth not working for agent with ssl enabled`


4.5.1 (2012/09/23)
------------------

This release essentially contains some minor fixes. The deployment view has a subtle change: all (leaf) steps are now links: when you hover your mouse over one of them you can click on it and it is a shortcut to the agent view page (fix for glu-163).

* Fixed `glu-155 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/155>`_: `shell.exec leaks file descriptors`
* Fixed `glu-163 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/163>`_: `Deployment view does not have agent links when model has parents`
* Fixed `glu-165 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/165>`_: `symlinks are not being shown in the console`


4.5.0 (2012/08/15)
------------------

This release contains a refactoring of the authorization framework in order to be able to change the authorization levels via :ref:`configuration <console-configuration-security-levels>` as well as being entirely customizable via :ref:`plugins <goe-plugins>`.

.. warning:: The property ``console.authFilters.rest.write.roleName`` has been removed from the configuration file. Instead you can define your own level per REST call.

.. note:: The prefixes ``/release`` and ``/admin`` which used to determine the level of authorization in the various URLs, have been removed since they do not serve this purpose anymore and as a result could be very confusing.

* Implemented `glu-140 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/140>`_: `Revisit permission/authorization system`
* Fixed `glu-152 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/152>`_: `NPE when no Step in execution plan`
* Fixed `glu-154 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/154>`_: `make console-cli return 1 on failure` (Thanks to St√©phane)


4.4.2 (2012/07/26)
------------------

This release contains mostly bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fixed `glu-111 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/111>`_: `Console server initialization fails with Oracle 11g` (Thanks to Chris for the tip)
* Implemented `glu-141 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/141>`_: `Add documentation about mysql configuration`
* Fixed `glu-144 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/144>`_: `Addition of pre-setup Java version check` (Thanks to Stuart)
* Implemented `glu-147 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/147>`_: `Allow to limit (optionally) massive parallel deployment`
* Fixed `glu-151 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/151>`_: `Allow '_' in mountPoint`

4.4.1 (2012/07/04)
------------------

This release contains a critical bug fix

* Fixed `glu-150 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/150>`_: `Cannot change password`

4.4.0 (2012/04/28)
------------------

This release further improves the performance of the previous one.

.. warning:: Unlike the previous release, for performance reasons, the default is now to compute the checksum system model using jackson output. 
             As a result, the **same** model loaded prior to 4.4.0 will have a different checksum. 
             If this turns out to be an issue in your case (which should be extremely unlikely if you usually "move forward"), then you can disable this behavior and revert back to the previous computation using the following configuration property in your (console) configuration file::

                console.systemModelRenderer.maintainBackwardCompatibilityInSystemId=true

List of tickets:

* Fixed `glu-139 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/139>`_: `Fix documentation for ZooKeeper URL`
* Implemented `glu-138 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/138>`_: `Make pretty printing configurable`
* Merged `glu-137 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/137>`_: `Place focus in username input text field on page load` (thanks to Tom)

4.3.1 (2012/03/31)
------------------

Mostly a performance improvement release: use of the jackson library to enhance memory consumption and speed particularly visible on large system models.

.. note:: Some (json) pretty printed output may look slightly different due to the change in serialization library.

.. note:: For backward compatibility reasons, the computation of the checksum for the system model has not been modified and still uses the ``org.json`` library.

.. tip:: As an added benefit for using a more powerful json parsing library, you can 
   now:

   * use comments (java style ``//`` or ``/* */``) in your json model (note that the comments are **not** preserved, but it won't generate an error when parsing!)
   * use single quotes
   * don't quote keys

List of tickets:

* Implemented `glu-132 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/132>`_: `Enhance glu's performance by integrating jackson`
* Fixed `glu-133 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/133>`_: `Be able to run GLU on IBM's JDK` (thanks to Lucas)


4.3.0 (2012/03/18)
------------------

4.3.0 introduces:

* the ability to define your own system wide state machine (check the glu script chapter in the documentation for 
  details)::

	defaultTransitions =
	[
	  NONE: [[to: 's1', action: 'noneTOs1']],
	  s1: [[to: 'NONE', action: 's1TOnone'], [to: 's2', action: 's1TOs2']],
	  s2: [[to: 's1', action: 's2TOs1']]
	]
        defaultEntryState = 's2'


* customize the actions for a given mountPoint on the agents page

  .. image:: /images/release/v4.3.0/mountPointActions.png
     :align: center
     :alt: mountPoint actions

* customize the plans available on the ``Plans`` subtab

  .. image:: /images/release/v4.3.0/plans.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Plans

* define your own set of custom plan type (or redefine one, like the meaning of "Bounce") (check the plugin hook 
  documentation)::

	def PlannerService_pre_computePlans = { args ->
	  switch(args.params.planType)
	  {
	    case "customPlan":
	      args.params.state = "installed"
	      return plannerService.computeTransitionPlans(args.params, args.metadata)
	      break

	    default:
	      return null
	  }
	}


List of tickets:

* Fixed `glu-127 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/127>`_: `cannot issue stop from cli`
* Implemented `glu-128 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/128>`_: `Allow customization of the default state machine`
* Fixed `glu-129 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/129>`_: `Exception when calling stop with nothing to do`


4.2.0 (2012/02/16)
------------------

4.2.0 introduces the ability to package a glu script as a precompiled class (or set of classes) inside one (or more) jar file(s). As a result, a glu script can inherit from another class as well as have external (to glu) dependencies! Check :ref:`glu-script-packaging` for more info.

* Implemented `glu-118 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/118>`_: `Add classpath / compiled glu script capability`
* Fixed `glu-120 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/120>`_: `Release user can't load model via the cli`
* Fixed `glu-121 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/121>`_: `Admin user can't load model via the cli`
* Fixed `glu-124 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/124>`_: `REST api should not use current logged in user session`
* Implemented `glu-125 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/125>`_: `add extra link shortcut in the dashboard`
* Implemented `glu-126 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/126>`_: `Add REST api for manipulating fabrics`


4.1.1 (2012/01/27)
------------------

.. note:: Issue 116 introduces a change in the default handling of delta vs error (requested by both LinkedIn and Orbitz): when an application is not running and there is a delta, it is better to treat it as an error instead of a simple delta because it represents the fact that something is wrong. 
          You can revert to the previous behavior (delta is never treated as an error) by adding the configuration parameter to your (console) configuration file::

            console.deltaService.stateDeltaOverridesDelta = false

* Fixed `glu-115 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/115>`_: `NPE when creating undeploy/redeploy plan for a model with child/parent relationship`
* Fixed `glu-116 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/116>`_: `DELTA takes priority over ERROR in the UI`
* Fixed `glu-117 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/117>`_: `shell.fetch generates Authorization header when not required`


4.1.0 (2011/12/29)
------------------

.. warning:: The following configuration parameters have changed in the console configuration file. If you are using the feature *restricting file access on an agent* then you need to rename them prior to starting the 
             new console when upgrading::

               console.authorizationService.unrestrictedLocation  -> plugins.StreamFileContentPlugin.unrestrictedLocation
               plugins.StreamFileContentPlugin.unrestrictedRole (new and optional value)

This version of glu adds the concept of plugins to the orchestration engine/console which allows you to enhance and/or tweak the behavior of glu. Typical uses cases are the ability to entirely change the authentication mechanism used by glu, send a notification when a deployment ends, prevent a deployment by the wrong user or at the wrong time, etc... Check the orchestration engine documentation for more information about plugins. This new version sets up the infrastructure for plugins and adds a handful of hooks. Future versions will contain more hooks (depending on user needs).

4.0.0 (2011/11/17)
------------------

What is new in 4.0.0 ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: 2 configuration parameters have changed in the console configuration file and you need to rename them prior to starting the 
             new console when upgrading (see the :ref:`configuration section <console-configuration>` for more details on the values)::

               model  -> shortcutFilters
               system -> model
  

4.0.0 contains a major redesign of the console with an easier to use interface and ability to create custom dashboards.

* Top navigation changes:

  * added ``Agents`` tab which lists all the agents (nodes) with direct access to individual agents
  * renamed ``Plans`` into ``Deployments``
  * ``System`` tab is gone and has been replaced with a combination of the ``Model`` tab and the ``Plans`` subtab in the dashboard
  * ``Model`` tab is now used to view the models previously loaded as well as load a new one
  * Fabric selection is now a drop down (same for filter shortcuts (``All [product]``))

* Dashboard is now customizable and a user can create different dashboards (see the :ref:`dashboard section<console-dashboard>` for details). The dashboard represents a table view of the `delta`. Both columns and rows can be customized:

  * columns can be customized: ability to add/remove/move any column. Clicking on a column name does a `'group by'` on the column and make it the first column (same functionality as the `'group by checkbox'` from the previous version). What is rendered in the column is customizable, from the sort order to the grouping functionality (when using `summary` view)
  * rows can be customized: you can add a filter to the model which essentially filters which row is displayed. Clicking on a value in a cell now adds a filter (this functionality existed with the difference that it was `replacing` instead of `adding`). You can of course remove a filter.
  * to customize the dashboard, there is a new subtab for it: ``Customize`` (this gives you access to the raw json representation of the dashboard which you can then tweak, like moving columns around or adding/removing new ones)
  * the first subtab on the dashboard allows you to quickly switch between your saved dashboards and also contains a very useful ``Save as New`` entry which allows you to save what you see as a new dashboard (so instead of tweaking the json, you can add filters and move columns around and then save it as a new dashboard which you can then tweak)

* Dashboard selection is now sticky which means if you move around and come back to the dashboard it will be in the same state. This is used for the ``Plans`` subtab of the dashboard which allows you to `act` on the delta: actions will be based on the filter currently set. If you want to act on the full system (old ``System`` tab), simply clear all filters.

* You can now give a name to your model and it will be displayed in addition to the SHA-1 (``metadata.name``)

* Downgraded security level for model manipulation (load/save) from ``ADMIN`` to ``RELEASE``

* Clicking on the name of an agent in the dashboard table used to link to the agent. By default it now behaves like any other value: adding a filter. You can now access an agent using the ``Agents`` tab. If you want to revert to the previous behavior, use this configuration property: ``dashboardAgentLinksToAgent: true`` in ``console.defaults``.

* Renamed ``console.defaults.model`` into ``console.defaults.shortcutFilters``: this functionality is now a simple shortcut that allows to switch between various predefined filters (example of usage: changing zones, changing products, changing teams, etc...)

* Renamed ``console.defaults.system`` into ``console.defaults.model``: to be consistent with the UI where you are looking at models

3.4.0 (2011/10/10)
------------------

A few changes to the agent (requires upgrade):

* Now the agent saves its fabric in ZooKeeper on boot (since it can be overriden on the command line, it ensures that the console sees the same value!)
* The agent offers a ``/config`` REST api after full boot (which allows to change the fabric after the agent has booted (but it still requires a manual agent reboot... will be implemented later))
* Fixed timing issue on auto upgrade
* Fixed the order in which properties are read to make sure that properties assigned in a previous run are used as default values and never override new values!

Several new REST apis:

* ``GET /-/``: list all fabrics
* ``GET /-/agents``: list agent -> fabric association
* ``PUT /<fabric>/agent/<agent>/fabric``: assign a fabric to an agent
* ``DELETE /<fabric>/agent/<agent>/fabric``: clear the fabric for an agent (also added to the UI ``Admin/View agents fabric``)
* ``DELETE /<fabric>/agent/<agent>``: `decommission` and agent (clear ZooKeeper of all agent information)  (also added to the UI ``Admin/View agents fabric``)

Upgraded to ``linkedin-utils-1.7.1`` and ``linkedin-zookeeper-1.4.0`` to fix #95

3.3.0 (2011/09/16)
------------------

This release features the following:

* Performance tuning (minimizing GC) based on LinkedIn feedback
* UI change: text area for modifying the model can be (optionally) made non editable (see :ref:`documentation <console-configuration-non-editable-model>`)
* UI change: selecting the current system/model is done through a radio group selection under the ``System`` tab
* UI change: selecting a plan is no longer a drop down selection (this was discussed in the `forum <http://glu.977617.n3.nabble.com/RFC-Selecting-a-plan-proposal-td3333742.html>`_)
* UI change: on the dashboard, there is now a different color for ``DELTA`` vs ``ERROR``
* UI customization: added powerful ability to provide your own custom stylesheet (see :ref:`documentation <console-configuration-custom-css>`) allowing you to easily tweak the rendering (colors, layout, etc...)
* Added documentation example on how to use a :ref:`different database <console-configuration-database-mysql>` with glu (MySql in this example)

3.2.0 (2011/07/31)
------------------

Enhanced REST API by exposing more functionalities (agent upgrade, deployments, plans). Note that the REST call ``HEAD /plan/<planId>/execution/<executionId>`` now returns a header called ``X-glu-completion`` (the old one ``X-LinkedIn-GLU-completion`` is still returned for backward compatibility).

* Implemented `glu-66 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/66>`_: `implement rest call GET /plans`
* Fixed `glu-81 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/81>`_: `Sometimes ste.message is null. It is null when the exception is java.util`
* Fixed `glu-82 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/82>`_: `Add some spacing around the pagination items.`
* Fixed `glu-83 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/83>`_: `NPE at http://glu/console/plan/deployments/XXX`

3.1.0 (2011/07/26)
------------------

Added unit test framework for glu script and created sibling project `glu-script-contribs <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu-scripts-contrib>`_

* Implemented `glu-80 <https://github.com/pongasoft/glu/issues/80>`_: `Add ability to write unit tests for glu script`
* Added ``Shell.httpPost`` method

3.0.0 (2011/06/25)
------------------

What is new in 3.0.0 ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.0.0 adds the following features:

* :ref:`parent/child relationship <static-model-entries-parent>` which adds the capability of decoupling the lifecycle of a parent and a child 
  (typical examples being deploying a webapp inside a webapp container or deploying a bundle in an OSGi container)
* define the desired state of an entry in the model (:ref:`entryState <static-model-entries-entryState>`) which, for example, allows you to deploy an 
  application without starting it
* The console is no longer precomputing the various plans (deploy, bounce, undeploy and redeploy) and they are now computed on demand only
* The delta is now a first class citizen and a new rest API allows to :ref:`access it <goe-rest-api-get-model-delta>`
* The core of the orchestration engine (delta, planner and deployer) has been fully rewritten to offer those new capabilities (now in java
  which should provide some performance improvements over groovy).
