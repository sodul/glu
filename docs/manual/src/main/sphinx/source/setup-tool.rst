.. _setup-tool:

``setup.sh`` tool
=================
The setup tool is used during the :doc:`production setup <easy-production-setup>`. It comes bundled with glu under ``$GLU_HOME/bin`` (assuming that ``$GLU_HOME`` is the root of the glu distribution. In order to get more help, simply issue::

  $GLU_HOME/bin/setup.sh -h

.. tip::
   By default, the setup tool uses the current directory for its output. It is then recommended to ``cd`` into the target directory and issue ``$GLU_HOME/bin/setup.sh`` commands. Note that you can also use the ``-o xxxx`` to specify the target directory, or enter it when prompted.

.. tip::
   When you run with the ``-h`` option, the output will show where the defaults are located on your drive.

The tool has essentially 3 modes which are used during the setup process.

.. _setup-tool_K:

1. Generating keys ``[-K]``
---------------------------

.. image:: /images/glu-setup-K-800.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Generating keys

This command is used to generate the keys for glu (securing the communication to the agents).

Example usage::

  setup.sh -K -o /tmp/keys --keys-dname "CN=Yan P., OU=IT, O=Acme, L=Mountain View, S=CA, C=US"

* ``-K`` (or ``--gen-keys``): to generate the keys
* ``-o``: the directory in which to generate the set of keys 
* ``--keys-dname``: to provide your own `X.500 distinguished name <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html#DName>`_ for the certificates.

.. _setup-tool_D:

2. Generating the distributions ``[-D]``
----------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/glu-setup-D-800.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Generating the distributions

This command is used to generate the distributions, which are ready to install/run packaged tailored to **your** environment.

Example usage::

  setup.sh -D -o /tmp/distributions/staging --config-templates "<default>" \
           --config-templates /tmp/glu-meta-model/config-templates /tmp/glu-meta-model/my-meta-model.json.groovy

* ``-D`` (or ``--gen-dist``): to generate the distributions
* ``-o``: the directory in which to generate the distributions
* ``--config-templates "<default>"``: use the config templates that comes with glu
* ``--config-templates xxx``: use your own (cumulative)
* ``--agents-only``: generate the distributions only for agents
* ``--consoles-only``: generate the distributions only for consoles
* ``--zookeeper-clusters-only``: generate the distributions only for ZooKeeper clusters
* ``--keys-root``: only used if you define relative uris for the keys in the meta model (rarely used)
* ``--packages-root``: only used if you do not want to use the packages that come with glu (rarely used)

.. note::
   ``config-templates`` is cumulative, meaning you can define as many as you want and they will all be processed. The order is **important**. It is strongly recommended to always use ``--config-templates "<default>"`` first, then your own.

.. _setup-tool_Z:

3. Configure ZooKeeper clusters ``[-Z]``
----------------------------------------

.. image:: /images/glu-setup-Z-800.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Configure ZooKeeper clusters

This command is used to upload the configuration (that was generated during the ``-D`` phase) to the ZooKeeper clusters. This means that you should run ``-D`` prior to using this command.

.. note::
   In order for this command to succeed, the ZooKeeper clusters must be up and running.

Example usage::

  setup.sh -Z -o /tmp/distributions/staging /tmp/glu-meta-model/my-meta-model.json.groovy

* ``-Z`` (or ``--configure-zookeeper-clusters``): to configure the ZooKeeper clusters
* ``-o``: the directory in which the distributions were generated (provided during ``-D``)
* ``--zookeeper-cluster-name``: only configure the cluster with the provided name (cumulative)

.. note::
   For simplicity and consistency, the ``-o`` option is being reused although in this case it is not an output folder, but an input one: Nothing will be written in this folder during this step.

.. note::
   ``zookeeper-cluster-name`` is cumulative so you can provide more than one.

.. _setup-tool_J:

4. Showing the json model ``[-J]``
----------------------------------
This command is used to render the meta model in json format.

.. tip::
   The meta model comes with a lot of default values (example: the agent port is ``12906``), which means that if you do not define it in the meta model, the default value will be used. This representation fully expand and show all default values.

Example usage::

  setup.sh -J /tmp/glu-meta-model/my-meta-model.json.groovy
